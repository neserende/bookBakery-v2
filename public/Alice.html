<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<h2>DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE.</h2>
<a href="www.google.com">Click to go to google</a>
<p>ALICE was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after
it, never once considering how in the world
she was to get out again.</p>
<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very
deep well.</p>
<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell
very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her, and to wonder
what was going to happen next. First, she tried
to look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything :
then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards
and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps
and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down
the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without
pictures or conversations ?”</p>
<p>So she was considering in her own mind,
(as well as she could, for the hot day made
her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER 2<h1>
<h2>Second small chapter</h2>
<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in
that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
“ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,
her, still it was good practice to say it over)
“ —yes, that ’s about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
I ’ve got to ?” </p>

<p>(Alice had not the slightest
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but
she thought they were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “ I wonder if
I shall fall right through the earth! How funny
it’ll seem to come out among the people that
walk with their heads downwards ! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there
was no one listening, this time, as it didn ’t
sound at all the right word) “ —but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New
Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey
as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling
through the air ! Do you think you could
manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl
she’ll think me for asking ! No, it’ll never do
to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”</p>

<p>a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it
was labelled “ ORANGE MARMALADE,” but
to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into
one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>

<p>“Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ’ll all
think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
the house !” (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never
come to an end ? “ I wonder how many miles
I ’ve fallen by this time ?” she said aloud. “I
must be getting somewhere near the centre of
the earth. Let me see : that would be four
thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see,
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a very good opportunity for showing off
her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to</p>

<h1>CHAPTER 3<h1>
<h2>Was she hurt?</h2>
<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
on to her feet in a moment : she looked up,
but it was all dark overhead; before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was
still in sight, hurrying down it. </p>

<p>There was
not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like
the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as
it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers,
how late it ’s getting !” She was close behind
it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit
was no longer to be seen : she found herself in
a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof.</p>
